## About Zefire

> **Note:** This repository contains the core code of the Zefire framework. If you want to build an application using Zefire, visit the main [Zefire repository](https://github.com/zefireio/zefire).

Zefire is a web application framework which attempts to provides an elegant and easy to use set of features common to most of web projects, such as:

- Inversion Of Control.
- ORM and Database layer.
- Routing.
- Template Engine.
- Queueing.
- Events.
- Console.
- Middlewares.
- Conventional back-end features, (such as Sessions, caching, storage, etc).


Zefire was designed to be fairly light yet powerful enough to provide tools needed for most projects.
